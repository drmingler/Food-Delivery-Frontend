## Would-You-Rather
An application that allows you play the  “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. This App was built as part of Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.
